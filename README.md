## Options
> This repository provides two approaches to getting started with reV:
### [A Jupyter Notebook, rev-demo.ipynb](rev-demo.ipynb)
Allows you to read steps and execute *in-line*
### [A Markdown file, rev-demo.md](rev-demo.md)
Contains a step-by-step tutorial as text. You must execute these commands yourself.
## Usage
> Their contents are more or less identical, but regardless I'd recommend using the Jupyter Notebook paired with e.g. [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) for ease of use.
